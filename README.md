# Microsoft_Excel
My Microsoft Excel Project. 

This project is interesting, we copy information from our bike_buyers tab, onto a worksheet so that the original information isn't altered if any mistakes occured.

Then we clean the data in the excel file (making the cells more readable, removing duplicates, etc) , and create a new column to make one of our visualizations easier (age bracket).

With this information we now use charts to represent and measure certain correlations between the buyers of our company's bikes and certain demographics, to see do any trends emmerge?

Finally we beautify the data in Dashboard, insert slicers with in each chart to make it interactive, if either a representative of the company or co-worker wants to see how certain demographics 
effect the sales of our bikes, and which discrepancies make the LARGEST difference.
